# Jade Flight Booking System

## Introduction
JADE (Object Orientated Database) Flight Booking System
This is a Flight Booking System, Object Orientated Database that I created during my second year at SIT for one of my class projects.

## Installation & Launching the Application
To run this application JADE v7.1 needs to be downloaded and installed in order to view this. This can be downloaded free from https://www.jadeworld.com/developer-center/download-jade where a Free Developer License can be obtained.

Once Jade is installed and Launched (by clicking the JADE.exe and login with no password), this Schema can then be Imported. When Importing **Select Multiple Schema** and then point it to the Schemas Directory from this GitHub.

The Application can be launched in JADE by clicking the **ProjectViewSchema** Schema and right-clicking the Green Arrow in JADE.

## On First Launch
Because the Schema will not contain any Instances of the Objects, they will need to be created via the New Database Button on the Login Screen.

The Master Password is **BenKing** and once it has created the new Instances the user can now login with the username **admin** and password **admin**.

## Other Bits and Pieces
The Documentation PDF Has a more In-depth Explanation of how to use this application, as well as its Purpose.
The Jade Project Handout Features the Projects Instructions and what the marking Criteria was for this Project.

## Marks
For this project, I got an A, and overall for the JADE Class, I got an A+. This resulted in me being the highest student in this class awarded the Jade Top Programmer Award at the SIT Prize Giving 2019
