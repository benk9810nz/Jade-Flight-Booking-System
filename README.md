# Jade Flight Booking System

## Introduction
JADE (Object Orientated Database) Flight Booking System
This is a Flight Booking System, Object Orientated Database that I created during my second year at SIT for one of my class Projects.

## Installation & Launching the Application
To run this application JADE v7.1 needs to be downloaded and installed in order to view this. This can be downloaded free from https://www.jadeworld.com/developer-center/download-jade where a Free Developer License can be obtained.

Once Jade is installed and Launced (by clicking the JADE.exe and logining in with no password), this Schema can then be Imported. When Importing **Select Multiple Schema** and then point it to the Scehmas Directory from this GitHub.

The Application can be launced in JADE by clicking the **ProjectViewSchema** Schema and right clicking the Green Arrow in JADE.

## On First Launch
Because the Schema will not contain any Instances of the Objects, they will need to be created via the New Database Button on the Login Screen.

The Master Password is **BenKing** and once it has created the new Instances the user can now login with the username **admin** and password **admin**.

The Documentation PDF Has a more Indepth Explanation of how to use this application, as well as its Purpose.
